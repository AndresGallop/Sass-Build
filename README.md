# Sass-Build

In this project I will buil some modules to get all the index.html page well organized.

I will create at least 5 modules with Sass, that way my CSS file will be updated whit the command sass --watch sass:css --style compressed from my terminal. I am using git bash for this project.

Also, I will change little things from the page in order to make it more aligned and well-looked.

I will have a master.scss where I am going to export the other sass files to the CSS master file from.
